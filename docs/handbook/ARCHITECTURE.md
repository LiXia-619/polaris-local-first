# Architecture

Polaris is a local-first AI workspace. The shared product runtime lives in `src/`; web,
selfhost, iOS, and Android wrappers should consume that shared runtime instead of copying product
semantics into platform shells.

## Layer Direction

The intended dependency direction is:

```txt
types -> config -> engines -> stores -> app -> ui
```

Platform and infrastructure boundaries sit beside the shared runtime:

```txt
native / infrastructure / server adapters -> engines or stores through explicit APIs
```

Do not invert this by importing shell UI from chat orchestration, store internals from components,
or native bridge details from product logic.

## Layer Responsibilities

| Layer | Owns | Must not own |
|---|---|---|
| `src/types/` | Shared product contracts and domain types. | Runtime decisions, persistence, UI state. |
| `src/config/` | Static catalogs, prompts, presets, and selector registries. | User state, generated runtime facts. |
| `src/engines/` | Pure or reusable logic: LocalData contracts, request building, provider runtime, tool protocol, theme math, import checks. | React state, store lifecycle, visual layout. |
| `src/stores/` | Durable client projections and five product stores: space, chat, collection, persona, runtime. | Rendering, provider transport policy, platform shell behavior. |
| `src/app/` | Orchestration hooks and controllers that connect stores, engines, and product workflows. | Low-level persistence contracts, visual styling. |
| `src/ui/` | React presentation, shell surfaces, and interaction components. | Source-of-truth decisions, migration logic, hidden side effects. |
| `src/infrastructure/` | Browser/native storage helpers, asset blob storage, and low-level persistence facilities. | Product ownership semantics. |
| `src/native/`, `ios/`, `android/` | Platform capabilities: SQLite plugin, files, notifications, WebView shell integration. | Duplicated chat, theme, collection, or persona product logic. |

## Five Stores

The product state layer has five stores:

- `spaceStore` — workspace frame, theme/frontstage/display state, saved skins, collaborator theme
  state.
- `chatStore` — conversations, messages, tasks, drafts, groups, chat workflow state.
- `collectionStore` — cards, image cards, room projects, project files, workspace reference doc
  directory rows.
- `personaStore` — collaborators/personas, active collaborator, persona settings, memory heads.
- `runtimeStore` — providers, model settings, tools, MCP, web search, voice/image settings,
  triggers, companion connection state.

Do not merge these stores. Do not add a sixth store unless the product has a genuinely new durable
state family.

## Data Spine

LocalData is the durable facts contract. Domain rows are the current source for active product
facts; old data participates only at explicit import, migration, census, health, or recovery
boundaries.

The normal path is:

```txt
UI intent -> app controller -> store action -> domain persistence facade -> LocalData row engine
```

The import path is separate:

```txt
package evidence -> parse/validate -> reconstruct LocalData rows -> promote coherent domains
```

Do not make ordinary startup read old storage as if it were current data.

## Tool Spine

Model-visible tools must close the full loop:

```txt
schema + prompt visibility -> parser/canonicalizer -> ToolAction -> describer -> preview/executor
-> UI evidence -> request-context replay -> tests
```

`toolExecutorDescribe.ts` is intentionally a dispatcher. Domain description logic lives in
`toolExecutorDescribe<Domain>.ts` modules; feature execution belongs in the appropriate app,
engine, or store module.

## Theme Spine

Theme tooling uses the preview/apply/rollback contract:

```txt
theme action -> description metadata -> preview transaction -> visible theme state
-> apply or rollback
```

The describer may attach preview metadata. It must not write CSS, apply a skin, or decide layout
geometry. Theme can change look; layout geometry belongs to the layout contract and shell
geometry owners.

## Platform Boundary

Most product behavior should be fixed once in `src/`. Use `ios/`, `android/`, `src/native/`, and
desktop bridge code only for real platform capabilities: storage, file access,
notifications, native HTTP, SQLite, and shell integration.

When diagnosing a platform report, first ask:

1. Is the behavior shared product logic in `src/`?
2. Is there an explicit platform branch?
3. Is a native capability actually involved?
4. Which channel needs release verification?

Source fixed is separate from web selfhost, Android APK, iOS/TestFlight, and App Store release
state.
