# LocalData

## Purpose

LocalData is the durable facts contract for app data.

## Owns

- Domain row ownership.
- Row states such as complete, unloaded, incomplete, timed out, and deleted.
- Commit validation and readback.
- Backend abstraction across KV, memory, Node SQLite, and native SQLite.
- Domain promotion, import, migration, health, and census invariants.

## Does Not Own

- UI layout.
- Provider networking.
- Model request construction.
- Native product semantics.

## Main Entrypoints

- `src/engines/localData/`
- `src/stores/localDataStorePersistence.ts`
- `src/stores/storeLocalDataBackendHost.ts`
- `src/app/bootstrap/storeLocalDataBackendBootstrap.ts`
- `src/native/localDataSqlite.ts`

## Data It Reads

- LocalData rows and active-source rows.
- Domain metadata rows.
- Backend key discovery results.
- Imported or migrated staging rows when called through explicit boundaries.

## Data It Writes

- Domain rows.
- Domain metadata rows.
- Active source rows.
- Tombstones and historical lifecycle marker rows.

## Important Failure States

- Duplicate row keys in a commit.
- Attempted downgrade or cross-domain write.
- Deleted row overwrite without explicit restore.
- Backend verification/readback failure.
- Split current data path, where one reader bypasses the installed backend host.

## Tests And Verification

- `npm run test:data-boundary`
- `src/engines/localData/localDataRepository.test.ts`
- `src/engines/localData/localDataBackendContract.test.ts`
- `src/app/bootstrap/storeLocalDataBackendBootstrap.test.ts`
- `src/native/localDataSqliteNativeParity.test.ts`

## Known Cleanup Still Owed

- Browser/self-host stays KV-backed until a separate browser SQLite/WASM decision is designed and proven.
- Future storage work should keep LocalData as the contract and avoid direct SQLite reads from stores or UI.
